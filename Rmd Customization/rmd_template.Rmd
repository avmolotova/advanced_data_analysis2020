```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE)
```

This template is created as a comfortable skeleton for the further projects and doesn't contain any semantic load either in data or table/plot. I understand that it is better to load all necessary package in the first chunk, but I still prefer to load libraries in the chunks where the function first appears, since it can be easily understood where the function is from.

# Scrapping {#anchor} 

## Loading libraries

```{r libraries}
library("rvest")
library("WikipediR")
```

# Logistic regression

## Data

```{r load data}
data(iris) #random data that came to my mind
```

## Descriptive statistics

```{r stats}
library(psych)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
describe(iris) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Table N. Add title here") %>% 
  kable_minimal() #don't create a bike here
```

## Not-custom ggplot & new opportunities!

I just wanted to add some ggplot into this template and try the package we recently found out about

```{r ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

s = ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = `Sepal.Length`, y = `Sepal.Width`, color = Species), show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Sepal", x = "Length", y = "Width") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  theme_minimal()

p = ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = `Petal.Length`, y = `Petal.Width`, color = Species)) +  
  labs(title = "Petal", x = "Length", y = "Width") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")+
  theme_minimal()

patchwork = s + p
patchwork + plot_annotation(
  title = 'Exploring irises'
)


#----------------------------------------
#thing that i got used to once -- saving plots and tables in png from r
#for patchwork-ggplot2-object-whatever we have to save this into an object and pass it:

#saveme = patchwork + plot_annotation(title = 'Exploring irises')
#ggsave('patchworksave.png', saveme)
```

<!-- During the work i accidentally pressed some buttons, didn't realized and this thing appeared. Never used it before and goggled that this is text comments and won't appear in html  -->

# Dimention reduction

# Clusters

# Bayes reflection

# Essays

**Essays** also can be written in *RMarkdown*, and text ~~formatting~~ is easy. `Add code example here` for the essay.

# Instead the conclusion

Today was introduced new [rmarkdown editor](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/) which looks aaaawesome and has a lot of new fun stuff! Just wanted to share :)

Thanks for the attention! I would appreciate any feedback regarding this template.
